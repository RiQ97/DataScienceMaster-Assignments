    "A2. The close() function in Python is used to close an open file. It is important to close a file after the transaction has been finished because of several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Resource Management: If not closed properly, the resources may remain allocated even after the transaction has been finished, leading to resource leakage and potentially causing the program to run out of available resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Data Integrity: Closing a file ensures that any data that has been buffered or cached in memory is properly flushed to the file on disk. If not closed, changes may not be saved, leading to data loss or corruption.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) File Locking: Closing the file releases any locks that may have been placed on it, allowing other operations on the file to proceed unimpeded.\n",
    "\n",
