The Python programming language was developed by Guido van Rossum, in 1991. Guido van Rossum continued to be the lead developer of Python until 2018."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Q2. Which type of programming does Python support?\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["A2. Python is a multi-paradigm programming language, which means that it supports multiple programming paradigms. Few of them are as follow:\n","\n","1. Procedural programming: A programming paradigm where code is written in a sequence. This is based on the use of functions, variables, and control flow statements such as if-else, for, and while.\n","\n","2. Object-oriented programming (OOP): A programming paradigm that focuses on the use of objects to represent real-world entities and their interactions. This is based on the use of classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.\n","\n","3. Functional programming: A programming paradigm that emphasizes the use of functions as first-class citizens. This is based on the use of higher-order functions, lambda functions, and the avoidance of mutable state.\n","\n","4. Aspect-oriented programming (AOP): A programming paradigm that focuses on the separation of concerns in a program. This is based on the use of decorators, which allow us to add new functionality to existing functions and classes."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Q3. Is Python case sensitive when dealing with identifiers?"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Yes, Python is case-sensitive when dealing with identifiers. An identifier is a name used to identify a variable, function, class, module, or other entity in Python. Identifiers in Python are case-sensitive, which means that the same identifier written with different capitalization is treated as a different identifier.Eg 'name' and 'Name' are two different variables."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Q4. What is the correct extension of Python file?"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["A4. '.py' is the correct extension used. The '.py' extension is used to indicate that the file contains Python code, and it is required by some tools and editors to recognize the file as a Python script."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Q5. Is Python good compiler or interpreted?"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["A5. Python is typically considered an interpreted language, not a compiled language. In a compiled language, the source code is translated into machine code before it is executed. Python is an interpreted language because it is executed by an interpreter, which reads and executes the source code line-by-line."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Q6. Name a few blocks of code used to define in Python language?\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["A6. A program is constructed from various code blocks, each of which serves a specific purpose. Here are some of the key code blocks used in Python:\n","\n","1. Module: A module is a file containing Python code that can be imported and used in other programs. It typically defines functions, classes, and variables. They are executed only once when imported.\n","\n","2. Function Body: A function body contains the actual implementation of a function. It consists of a sequence of statements that execute when the function is called. It can be executed many times.\n","\n","3. Class Definition: A class definition defines a blueprint for creating objects (instances). It includes attributes and methods that operate on those attributes. It define the behavior of objects.\n","\n","4. Interactive Commands: When you type commands interactively in the Python interpreter (REPL), each command is treated as a code block. These commands are executed immediately.\n","\n","5. Script File: A script file is a Python file executed from the command line or as standard input to the interpreter. It is also considered a code block.\n","\n","6. Script Command: A command specified on the interpreter command line using the -c option is also a code block.\n","\n","7. String Argument for eval() and exec(): The string argument passed to the built-in functions eval() and exec() is treated as a code block."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Q7. State a character used to give single line comments in Python?"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["A7. In Python, a single line comment is started with the '#' character. Anything following the '#' character on the same line is considered a comment and is ignored by the Python interpreter.\n","\n","Here's an example:"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["# This is a single line comment in Python"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Q8.

Python supports the creation of anonymous functions at runtime using a constructor called lambda. These are also known as lambda functions and are defined using the lambda keyword, followed by the parameters and a single expression. "]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Q10. What does pip stand for Python?"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["A10. The term “pip” stands for “Pip Installs Packages”. It is a recursive acronym and is the package manager used to install and manage software packages written in Python. Pip connects to the Python Package Index (PyPI) to download and install packages. It’s a crucial tool for Python developers as it streamlines the process of managing libraries and dependencies."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Q11. What is the maximum possible length of an identifier in Python?"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["A11. In Python, the maximum possible length of an identifier has no limits. As suggested by PEP 8, it should be grater than 79, to maintain readability and consistency in code. While Python itself does not enforce a strict limit on the length of identifiers, adhering to this guideline is considered best practice."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Q12. What are the benefit of using Python?"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Python offers numerous benefits that make it a popular choice for programmers worldwide. Here are some of the key advantages:\n","\n","1. Ease of Learning and Use: Python has a simple, readable syntax that’s close to English, making it accessible to beginners.\n","2.

How is memory managed in Python?"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["A13. Memory management in Python is handled automatically by the Python interpreter, which includes several components to manage memory efficiently:\n","\n","1. Garbage Collection: Python uses a garbage collector to de-allocate memory that is no longer in use. This process helps to free up memory for other objects and prevents memory leaks.\n","2. Reference Counting: Python internally keeps track of the number of references to each object in memory. When an object’s reference count drops to zero, meaning no references to the object exist, it is eligible for garbage collection.\n","3. Memory Pools: Python uses a system of memory pools for managing the allocation of memory to objects. This system helps to minimize the overhead of memory allocation and de-allocation.\n","4. Blocks and Arenas: Memory for Python objects is allocated in blocks, which are grouped into larger units called arenas. This structure helps to manage memory in a way that reduces fragmentation.\n","\n","The combination of these mechanisms ensures that Python programs can run efficiently without the programmer needing to manually manage memory."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Q14.
